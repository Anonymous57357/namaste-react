## HOW REACT IS FAST

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, which is a group of servers that work together to deliver content to users more quickly: 
How it works
When a user visits a website, the data from the website's server needs to travel across the internet to the user's computer. A CDN stores copies of the website's content on servers that are closer to the user, so the content loads faster. 

React.CreateElement is a object --> its a javascript object

root.render ==> is rendered a object and replace by h1 or any html tag
