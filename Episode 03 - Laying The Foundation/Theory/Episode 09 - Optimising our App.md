## custom hook (new entry)

# single responsibility principle

1. reusable ex: card
2. maintanable
3. testable

## each component can used for one purpose .. if there is more split into differn file for code readibility

# how to write a custom hook
1. we have to know what the input
2. we have to know what the output

// const   userOnlineStatus = () => {
//     // 1. input => there is input
//     return useOnlineStatus
//     // 2. output => retun somedata(userOnlineStatus)
// };

# optimization

## create a each component as a separea using laszy loading given by inbuild react
## use Suspance componets to wrapping the lozy component  to give better user experience
